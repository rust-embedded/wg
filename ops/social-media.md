# Social Media Guide

The [Resources Team] currently maintains three official social media accounts:

* [Twitter: @rustembedded](https://twitter.com/rustembedded)
    * Maintained by [@jamesmunns]
* [Cohost: @rustembedded](https://cohost.org/rustembedded)
    * Maintained by [@adamgreig] and [@jamesmunns]
* [Mastodon: @rustembedded@hachyderm.io]
    * Maintained by [@adamgreig]

## Operational Guide

The purpose of the social media accounts are to spread awareness of topics related to embedded rust.

Social Media accounts will typically:

1. Post about specific announcements from the working group, e.g. to tell people about some major new release, a breaking change, etc
2. Post WG blog posts
3. Repost/share people offering and seeking jobs, with reasonable rate-limiting (e.g. one post/week per person/group), see below for more info
4. Repost/share people's posts tagged/mentioning embedded rust, with reasonable rate-limiting (e.g. one post/week per person/group)
5. Repost/share other major Rust related posts, e.g. from the official Rust account

In general, we ask that all social media account maintainers use their best judgement to uphold the [Rust Code of Conduct], and operate the account in a way that is both generally appropriate in representing the Rust Embedded Working Group, as well as appropriate for the social media community and norms of that particular site.

[Rust Code of Conduct]: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct

## How to Share

Each platform has different mechanisms/norms for sharing content, or marking a post as "wanting to be reposted".

Social media accounts should periodically remind followers how to do this, and include it in the profile, if possible.

### For Twitter

On twitter, we ask that people "@ mention" the rustembedded account, e.g. include "@rustembedded" in a tweet.

The twitter account will directly be notified by these mentions.

### For Cohost

On Cohost, we ask that people include the [#rustembedded](https://cohost.org/rc/tagged/rustembedded) tag on their posts.

The cohost account follows this tag, and pulls posts from the stream.

### For Mastodon

TODO: James doesn't know how this works

## Job Postings

We will, at the account maintainer's discretion, repost "looking for work" or "job offer" posts. Generally with the twitter account, we've asked that:

* For Job offers, the job offer must:
    * Be public (e.g. a tweet, blog post, or on a public job posting board)
    * Mention Rust (may be one of multiple mentioned languages, but should be relevant to the posting)
    * Mention Embedded
* For "looking for work" posts, the user must:
    * Be an individual or business directly looking for work (e.g. not a staffing agency)
    * Mention Rust
    * Mention Embedded

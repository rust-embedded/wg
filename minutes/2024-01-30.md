## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * svdtools 0.3.9 released
* Embedded HAL
    * ADC/voltmeter/ammeter traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/569
        * Having volts and amps seems a bit arbitrary; should we also have temperature and light level and etc etc?
        * There might be some value in such a set of traits but it doesn't seem like they belong in e-h
        * Probably the original plan of an ADC trait is a better fit for embedded-hal, but there are design questions to resolve
    * SPI sharing with fallible CS pins https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/573
        * Perhaps the whole shared bus could be poisoned to reduce the runtime overhead
        * But given the rarity of requiring fallible pins and not being able to just wrap them in a panicking wrapper, perhaps option 1 remains the best option for e-h-bus, with users requiring more sophisticated sharing/error handling able to roll their own
        * @GrantM11235 to write a PR
* svd2rust
    * Safe/unsafe writers https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/788
* Continue last week's discussion on interrupt macro syntax across crates

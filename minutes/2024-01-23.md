## Agenda

* Announcements
    * svdtools 0.3.9 released
* Embedded HAL
    * ADC/voltmeter/ammeter traits https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/569
        * Having volts and amps seems a bit arbitrary; should we also have temperature and light level and etc etc?
        * There might be some value in such a set of traits but it doesn't seem like they belong in e-h
        * Probably the original plan of an ADC trait is a better fit for embedded-hal, but there are design questions to resolve
    * SPI sharing with fallible CS pins https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/573
        * Perhaps the whole shared bus could be poisoned to reduce the runtime overhead
        * But given the rarity of requiring fallible pins and not being able to just wrap them in a panicking wrapper, perhaps option 1 remains the best option for e-h-bus, with users requiring more sophisticated sharing/error handling able to roll their own
        * @GrantM11235 to write a PR
* svd2rust
    * Safe/unsafe writers https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/pull/788
* Continue last week's discussion on interrupt macro syntax across crates

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * embedded-hal v1.0.0 released! :tada: 
    * risc-v releases: risc-v 0.11, riscv-rt 0.12, riscv-pac 0.1, riscv-semihosting 0.1
    * linux-embedded-hal 0.4 was released with embedded-hal updated to 1.0
* Commonality between cortex-m and riscv interrupt macros
    * Could we unify the interrupt-declaring syntax?
    * Currently riscv-rt just has the user export a suitably-named symbol, which would also work for c-m-rt
        * But this doesn't permit the &static mut transform, or ensure that the method can't be called except by hardware as an interrupt, and doesn't check the function type signature
        * We could recommend this for c-m-rt
    * Could c-m-rt's interrupt macro take the interrupt name as an (optional?) argument, so the function could then be named arbitrarily instead?
        * avr-device requires the chip name be passed to the interrupt macro, so couldn't immediately work with this syntax, but maybe could be refactored later to support it
    * What about exception macros (e.g. when used to provide the exceptionframe in a hardfault on c-m-rt) or the entry macro (which also provides the static mut transform)?
    * TBC

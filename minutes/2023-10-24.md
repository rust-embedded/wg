## Agenda

* Announcements
    * New libs team created, with @dirbaio and @newam as the first members
    * heapless and volatile-register are now looked after by the new libs team
    * embedded-alloc and qemu-exit are moved to the libs team
    * new volatile-register 0.2.2 released with fix for struct repr
    * embedded-io 0.6.1 released with SliceWriteError made public
    * svd2rust 0.30.2 released
    * svd-rs 0.14.3 released
* Anti-spam bot check
* Rust target maintainers
    * PR submitted, no response yet
    * https://github.com/davidtwco/rust/pull/1
* cortex-m-interrupt-number
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/488
    * AG to verify this doesn't cause problems then we could probably release it
    * We should also make a plan to move PACs off cortex-m-rt too, so both c-m and c-m-rt can have major new versions without requiring every PAC to upgrade first.
* mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/13
* book: tooling page needs updating
* bors: ops docs needs updating
* heapless release of version 0.8
    * Plan is to merge whatever open PRs are mergeable and release 0.8 soon

## Last Week's Minutes

* Announcements
    * svdtools 0.3.4 released
* Anti-spam bot issue check
* New libs team
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/707
* wg readme update
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/708
    * If no objections we can merge this
* Rust target maintainers
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/704
    * Ready to submit PR, please do any final checks for RV32/MSP430/Cortex-M
* embedded-io
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/513 - What do we do with the 0.6 release?
* cortex-m-interrupt-number
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/488
    * is this a breaking change for cortex-m 0.7?
    * Test how this works out with a PAC that uses IN from c-m 0.7, and how it changes when the PAC uses the new c-m-in instead.
* Mutex trait
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/13
* volatile-register:
    * Should be able to move this to rewg soon and release an updated version to fix the unsoundness
* heapless:
    * Should also be able to move to rewg soon
